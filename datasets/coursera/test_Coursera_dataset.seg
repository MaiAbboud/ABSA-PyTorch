va muy lento el tema de la beca tarda demasiado asi que puedo avanzar un buen ritmo tuve que esperar demasiado para que arreglaran el problema con la semana 3 por eso perdã la fecha limite original para la ultima subi la tarea de la 3er semana ustedes decian que algo faltaba pero en la aplicacion dejaban ver nada de lo que estaba pasando asi que sabia que hacer ni habia nada que hacer si quejo en redes sociales de ustedes arreglan nada el video de insight de instagram muestra la informacion que se en la aplicacion en realidad estan tardando demasiado en darme mi certificado del primer curso asi que ver cuando dan el de este en el archivo de google doc la promociones se estan poniendo en el glog cuando en el examen dicen que esta en el sitio lo cual segun el video de este mismo curso e lo mismo el sitio que el blog son diferentes en resumen ustedes mismos tienen la informacion que no dan hecha un desastre va costar mã tiempo esfuerzo ponerlo en practica haciendolo con ustedes que siguiendo un course de youtube el cual e gratis inmediato asi su certificado la verdad vale la pena vale nada

este curso e perfecto para una iniciaciã³n al idioma coreano sin embargo e muy importante el estudio por tu cuenta para quedar rezagado durante el mismo en lo personal e un curso para principiantes con un leve conocimiento del hangul considero que e necesario un estudio previo acerca del hangul para evitar confusiones en la pronunciaciã³n de sã labas su vez de palabras oraciones

bueno por dã³nde empezar la verdad en la introducciã³n del curso pareciã³ interesante el tema de cã³mo aplicar la programaciã³n en la vida cotidiana sin embargo hasta la segunda semana funcionã³ bien el curso porque di cuenta con el paso la siguiente semana 3 que lo pedido en los cuestionarios correspondã al course de los video de la semana 4 entonces â cã³mo e posible evaluar algo que los instructores aãºn han mostrado entiendo que un deberã porque e una obligaciã³n avanzar mã por su cuenta bajo la propia responsabilidad pero e algo correcto en lo personal que decidan planificar en el curso la pregunta que le plantee anteriormente si bien hubo persona que invirtieron su dinero el cual e menor ya que el pago del curso e en usd puede variar mucho en su momento ademã pagaron por lo que se le estã cobrando para obtener el certificado ya que manifestaron en los foros su opiniã³n lo cual en lo personal considero que e un abuso para finalizar considero que los instructores leyeron todo lo que tenã que decir del panel se reflejado en los video ya que hay largo segundos de silencio opinaron tuvieron libertad de explicar desde lo personal lo que e lo que se quiere explicar
